# Image Classification Project

The project applied transfer learning technique to perform image classification. \
The MobileNetV2 model was chosen as it was pretrained with more than a million images from the ImageNet database. \
The base model of MobileNetV2 was kept with the trained parameters. Then Global Average Pooling layer, dense layer, prediction layer are add on top of the feature maps.\
A report of the project is included in the files.\
